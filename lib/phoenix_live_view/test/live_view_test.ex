  Conveniences for testing Phoenix live views.

  In LiveView tests, we interact with views via process
  communication in substitution of a browser. Like a browser,
  our test process receives messages about the rendered updates
  from the view which can be asserted against to test the
  life-cycle and behavior of live views and their children.

  ## LiveView Testing

  The life-cycle of a live view as outlined in the `Phoenix.LiveView`
  docs details how a view starts as a stateless HTML render in a disconnected
  socket state. Once the browser receives the HTML, it connects to the
  server and a new LiveView process is started, remounted in a connected
  socket state, and the view continues statefully. The LiveView test functions
  support testing both disconnected and connected mounts separately, for example:

      {:ok, view, html} = mount_disconnected(MyEndpoint, MyView, session: %{})

      assert html =~ "<h1>My Disconnected View</h1>"

      {:ok, view, html} = mount(view)
      assert html =~ "<h1>My Connected View</h1>"

      assert {:error, %{redirect: "/somewhere"}} =
             mount_disconnected(MyEndpoint, MyView, session: %{})

  Here, we call `mount_disconnected/3` and assert on the stateless
  rendered HTML that is received by the browser's HTTP request. Next, `mount/2`
  is called to mount the stateless view in a connected state which starts our
  stateful LiveView process.

  In general, it's often more convenient to test the mounting of a view
  in a single step, provided you don't need the result of the stateless HTTP
  render. This is done with a single call to `mount/3`, which performs the
  `mount_disconnected` step for us:

      {:ok, view, html} = mount(MyEndpoint, MyView, session: %{})
      assert html =~ "<h1>My Connected View</h1>"

  ## Testing Events

  The browser can send a variety of events to a live view via `phx-` bindings,
  which are sent to the `handle_event/3` callback. To test events sent by the
  browser and assert on the rendered side-effect of the event, use the
  `render_*` functions:

    * `render_click/3` - sends a phx-click event and value and
      returns the rendered result of the `handle_event/3` callback.

    * `render_submit/3` - sends a form phx-submit event and value and
      returns the rendered result of the `handle_event/3` callback.

    * `render_change/3` - sends a form phx-change event and value and
      returns the rendered result of the `handle_event/3` callback.

    * `render_keydown/3` - sends a form phx-keydown event and value and
      returns the rendered result of the `handle_event/3` callback.

    * `render_keyup/3` - sends a form phx-keyup event and value and
      returns the rendered result of the `handle_event/3` callback.

  For example:

      {:ok, view, _html} = mount(MyEndpoint, ThermostatLive, session: %{deg: 30})

      assert render_click(view, :inc) =~ "The temperature is: 31℉"

      assert render_click(view, :set_temp, 35) =~ "The temperature is: 35℉"

      assert render_submit(view, :save, %{deg: 30}) =~ "The temperature is: 30℉"

      assert render_change(view, :validate, %{deg: -30}) =~ "invalid temperature"

      assert render_keydown(view, :key, :ArrowUp) =~ "The temperature is: 31℉"

      assert render_keydown(view, :key, :ArrowDown) =~ "The temperature is: 30℉"

  ## Testing regular messages

  Live views are `GenServer`'s under the hood, and can send and receive messages
  just like any other server. To test the side effects of sending or receiving
  messages, simply message the view and use the `render` function to test the
  result:

      send(view.pid, {:set_temp: 50})
      assert render(view) =~ "The temperature is: 50℉"

  ## Testing shutdowns and stopping views

  Like all processes, views can shutdown normally or abnormally, and this
  can be tested with `assert_removed/3`. For example:

      send(view.pid, :boom)
      assert_removed view, {:shutdown, %RuntimeError{}}

      stop(view)
      assert_removed view, {:shutdown, :stop}

  Nested views can be removed by a parent at any time based on conditional
  rendering. In these cases, the removal of the view is detected by the
  browser, or our test client, and the child is shutdown gracefully. This
  can be tested in the same way as above:

      assert render(parent) =~ "some content in child"

      [child] = children(parent)
      send(parent.pid, :msg_that_removes_child)

      assert_removed child, _
      refute render(parent) =~ "some content in child"

  Mounts a static live view without connecting to a live process.

  Useful for simulating the rendered result that is sent with
  the intial HTTP request. On successful mount, the view and
  rendered string of HTML are returned in a ok 3-tuple.
  After disconnected mount, `mount/1` or `mount/2`
  may be called with the view, which performs a connected mount
  and spawns the LiveView process.

  For mount failures, an `{:error, reason}` returned.
